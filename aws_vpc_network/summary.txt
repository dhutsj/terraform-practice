1. AWS Internet Gateway has no EIP(no internet access itself), but it is needed for EC2 instances with EIP
in public subnet to access to internet. Run curl ifconfig.me inside the EC2 instance, you can see the EIP bind to it.

2. NAT Gateway must be sit in the public subnet.

3. EC2 Instances in private subnet must go through the NAT Gateway, even you bind an EIP to it. It still use the NAT Gateway 
EIP as outbound ip.
